# ELT Pipeline with PostgreSQL, Airflow, and DBT

This repository contains a simple ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline to transfer data from a source PostgreSQL database to a destination PostgreSQL database, orchestrated using Airflow and with transformations performed by DBT.



## Overview

This ELT pipeline performs the following tasks:
1. **Extract**: Reads data from a source PostgreSQL database.
2. **Load**: Dumps the extracted data into a destination PostgreSQL database.
3. **Transform**: Performs data transformations using DBT.

Airflow is used to orchestrate the workflow, ensuring that the extract, load, and transform tasks are executed in sequence.

## Prerequisites
